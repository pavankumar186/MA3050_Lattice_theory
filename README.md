# MA3050_Lattice_theory

Python code which creates the [Hasse diagram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HasseDiagram.html#:~:text=A%20Hasse%20diagram%20is%20a,1.) of any P.O.Set which is based on set inclusion. The hasse diagram can also be created for the power set of a given set.

The second part of the code is for getting the hasse diagrams for all the [ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)) for the power set of a given set.
